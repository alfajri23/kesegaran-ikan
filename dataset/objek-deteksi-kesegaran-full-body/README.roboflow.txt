The dataset includes 456 images.
Mata ikan segat dan mata tidak segar are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (reflect edges))
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -50 and +50 percent
